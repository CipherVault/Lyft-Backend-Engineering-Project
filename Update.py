	#Upgrade Spindler batteries:Modify the CapuletEngine class to update the engine_should_be_serviced method to require service after three years instead of two. You can achieve this by modifying the needs_service method to use years_threshold=3 instead of years_threshold=4 as follows:

class CapuletEngine(Car):
    def __init__(self, last_service_date, current_mileage, last_service_mileage):
        super().__init__(last_service_date)
        self.current_mileage = current_mileage
        self.last_service_mileage = last_service_mileage
    
    def engine_should_be_serviced(self, mileage_threshold=30000):
        return self.current_mileage - self.last_service_mileage > mileage_threshold
    
    def needs_service(self, years_threshold=3, mileage_threshold=60000):
        service_threshold_date = self.last_service_date.replace(year=self.last_service_date.year + years_threshold)
        return service_threshold_date < datetime.today().date() or self.engine_should_be_serviced(mileage_threshold)
		
#Add tire servicing criteria: Add a new method to the Car class 
# called tire_should_be_serviced that takes an array of tire wear values and 
# returns a boolean indicating whether the tires should be serviced based on the criteria for Carrigan and Octoprime tires. You can implement the method as follows: 

   class Car(ABC):
    def __init__(self, last_service_date):
        self.last_service_date = last_service_date
    
    @abstractmethod
    def engine_should_be_serviced(self):
        pass
    
    def needs_service(self, years_threshold=4, mileage_threshold=60000):
        service_threshold_date = self.last_service_date.replace(year=self.last_service_date.year + years_threshold)
        return service_threshold_date < datetime.today().date() or self.engine_should_be_serviced(mileage_threshold)
    
    def tire_should_be_serviced(self, tire_wear_values):
        if isinstance(self, Carrigan):
            return any(wear_value >= 0.9 for wear_value in tire_wear_values)
        elif isinstance(self, Octoprime):
            return sum(tire_wear_values) >= 3
        else:
            return False
			
#Then, add two new classes Carrigan and Octoprime that inherit from the Car class and override 
# the tire_should_be_serviced method to implement the specific criteria for their respective tire 
# types:

class Carrigan(Car):
    def tire_should_be_serviced(self, tire_wear_values):
        return any(wear_value >= 0.9 for wear_value in tire_wear_values)

class Octoprime(Car):
    def tire_should_be_serviced(self, tire_wear_values):
        return sum(tire_wear_values) >= 3
		
		
		#With these modifications, you can use the needs_service and tire_should_be_serviced 
        # methods to determine when a car needs servicing and when its tires need to be serviced, 
        # respectively.
